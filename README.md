# V4 Varrock Agility Course - Supports all marks of grace location & Human patterns & Return if fails!

## Guide
1. Copy the provided Java code into your code editor.
2. Save the file with an appropriate name.
3. Start at the agility course at varrock (should work 99.99% of time)
    - Worst case do the first course only and then start (this should not happen as it has been fixed, but I havn't seen the issue arise again and assume its fixed)


## Usage
- Running: If the character has enough energy, enable running for faster movement.
- Pick Up Grace: If there is a specific item called "Mark of Grace" on the ground nearby, the script will pick it up.
- Interacting with Objects: Depending on the character's location and nearby objects, the script may perform various actions. These actions include climbing walls, crossing objects like   
clotheslines or gaps, balancing on walls, hurdling over ledges, and jumping off edges. These actions are triggered when the character is in proximity to the corresponding objects.
- Fail-Safe Action: If none of the above conditions apply, the script will move to a randomly selected predefined point. This serves as a fail-safe measure to ensure the character continues its movement even if other actions are not possible after picking up mark of grace.
- Human Movement: The script also has human patterns so you don't look like a static bot, when you fail an agility course it will pick one of the many locations to run to before interacting with the first lap again.
